# Online Shop App

**Online Shop App** is a **React-based e-commerce application** developed as part of a comprehensive React course, focused on strengthening fundamental and intermediate React concepts through practical, project-based learning.

## 📌 Description

The application represents a simple **demo online shop platform for browsing and interacting with products**.  
The purpose of the project is not commercial use, but **learning through practical implementation** of key React technologies and modern frontend development concepts.

The project is developed as an exercise for:

- understanding React fundamentals  
- working with components and props  
- managing state and event handling  
- implementing client-side routing  
- integrating backend data (fetching and mutation)  
- writing automated tests  
- deploying a React application  

## 🧱 Architecture

The application is built according to a **component-based architecture**, which is the foundation of React development:

- **Components** – reusable UI building blocks  
- **Props** – passing data between components  
- **State** – managing dynamic and interactive data  
- **Hooks** – handling logic and lifecycle in functional components  
- **React Router** – managing navigation between pages  
- **API Integration** – communication with backend services  

This structure ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

## ⚙️ Functionalities

- Displaying product listings  
- Viewing individual product details  
- Client-side routing between pages  
- Fetching product data from backend  
- Updating/mutating product data  
- Basic e-commerce flow structure  
- Automated testing with Vitest  
- Deployment to the internet (AWS introduction)
